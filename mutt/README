Simple muttrc

Notes:
  * copy mailcap to ~/.mailcap. I use elinks for HTML mail.
  * the signature file is ~/.signature
  * the line:
  set editor = 'vim + -c "set textwidth=72" -c "set wrap" -c "set nocp" -c "\$-3" -c "setlocal spell! spelllang=en_us,bg"'

  "\$-3" - set the cursor 3 lines before the EOF - just before my signature
           modify this to reflect your signature
  spelling - also modify the spell check languages 


Work flow:
All sent mail goes to Inbox to simulate GMail's conversations.
After a thread is not relevant, it's moved to the Archive. That way
searching in all the mail is pretty easy and also all the mails I've
sent are present.
